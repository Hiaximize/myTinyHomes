## About
My Tiny Home is Marketplace Web App that allows users to post tiny homes for sale and contact sellers to purchase tiny homes.

## Motivation
We're millennials. We just love tiny homes!

## Wireframes


## User Stories

* Users should be able to view available tiny houses and prices before signing up or logging in the site

* Users should be able to click on any available house to view more details about the house and see an option to "sign in and contact lister" if they are not logged in or "contact lister" if they are logged in (authenticated).

* Users should be able to search all homes for certain key phases or sort the homes by price (from high-low or low-high).

* Users should be able to log in or sign up to have more site access.

## Home Sellers
* Authenticated Users should be able to list a house for sale and then edit or delete that house later. The user who posted the house should have their email automatically associated with the listing, so another user can contact them later.

## Home Buyers
* Authenticated Users should be able to contact the lister for any particular house.

* Authenticated Users should be able to save houses as favorites. Favorite houses should populate about the rest of the houses in a favorites section.

* Authenticated Users should be able to remove houses as favorites.

## Challenges / Example Code


## Future Improvements

Our original plan with this app was to allow users to actually use PayPal to buy and sell blueprints for properties. To do this, we would implement PayPal Sandbox which required OAuth 2.0. Unfortunately, we haven't learned to use OAuth 2.0 yet, so it would have required some extensive research and since we only had a few days to put this project together, that wasn't realistic for the timeframe we had been given. However, all of us have the goal of learning OAuth and still see the potential for implementing it in this project.


Another possible feature we could add, would be an embedded google map that shows the location of each home. Again, in this case we simply ran out of time, but hope to implement this in the future.
